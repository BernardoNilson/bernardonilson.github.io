During my internship at the High-Performance Laboratory of PUCRS, I developed a website to **facilitate access to important information** about the laboratory.

Until then, **the laboratory usage instructions were provided in a PDF document**. This led to outdated manuals for older users, as the PDF did not update automatically.

To solve this problem, I transferred the manual to a web page, which is constantly updated. The website also includes other important information, such as the YouTube tutorial channel and the University research impact page.

For the website development, I used Jekyll, a program written in Ruby that allows dynamic creation of websites and blogs using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used Bootstrap 5.0 for site styling. Jekyll is integrated with GitHub Pages, allowing the site to be hosted at no cost.

It was a **great opportunity** to learn new web development technologies and contribute to the laboratory. The website is already in use and is well received by users.

Here are some **benefits** of the new website:

- Always up-to-date information: The website is automatically updated, ensuring that users always have access to the latest information.
- Easy access: The website is accessible from any device with an internet connection.
- Responsive design: The website adapts to different screen sizes, providing a better browsing experience.
