# **{{ page.title }}**

During my internship at the High-Performance Laboratory of PUCRS, I resumed the development of a system for **visualizing the utilization statistics of the laboratory's resources**.

The system aims to **facilitate** the demonstration of the importance and impact of LabLAD for the University through interactive indicators and graphics.

**Before** the development of the dashboard, usage data was stored in Excel spreadsheets, which made analysis and visualization challenging.

To **solve** this problem, I used the Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, Dash, Dash-Bootstrap-Components, and Openpyxl to create an interactive dashboard. Bootstrap 5.0 was used to style the dashboard.

The dashboard **allows visualization of various statistics**, such as:

- Monitoring of demands for processing resources;
- Amount of CPU used per month in Cluster or in 24x7;
- Number of projects using laboratory resources;
- Storage utilization level.

The dashboard **also allows users to filter** data by group, project, date, and resource type.

It was a rewarding experience to develop a system that contributes to demonstrating LabLAD's impact on University research. The dashboard is already in use and is being well received.

Here are some of the **benefits** of the new dashboard:

- Clear and intuitive visualization: The dashboard uses interactive graphs and indicators to facilitate understanding of the information.
- Advanced filters: Users can filter data by different criteria, allowing for a deeper analysis of the information.

Thank you for your attention!
